List of prompts I found interesting when chatting with ChatGPT

##Welcome everyone!
I have pasted a list of useful prompts that has helped me over time with generating ideas on [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

###Prompt Creation
Craft the best prompt for me through a competition between two contestants. Contestant A is more precise and Contestant B is more creative. 

Follow these steps: 
1.) Ask me what the prompt should be about. 
2.) Each contestant must generate 1 rewritten prompt 
3.) Determine the response ChatGPT-3.5 would give to each rewritten prompt in no more than 100 characters. 
4.) Ask if either prompt is better than the other. 
5.) Ask at least 3 relevant questions that will help improve the prompt. 
6.) Continuously update both prompts until I say to stop.


###Education
Develop a coding tutorial on learning [WRITE DESIRED TOPIC].You are teaching a beginner with no experience and background. The goal is to teach the beginner everything an advanced ai language model knows about [WRITE DESIRED TOPIC]. Provide step by step instructions and specific examples to teach the beginner. Are you sure all outputs are correct?
